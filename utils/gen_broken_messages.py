"""Generate messages to be consumed by aggregator that are broken in some way.

This script read input message (that should be coorect) and generates bunch of
new messages. Each generated message is broken in some way so it is possible
to use such messages to test how broken messages are handled on aggregator
(ie. consumer) side.

Types of input message mutation:
* any item (identified by its key) can be removed
* new items with random key and content can be added
* any item can be replaced by new random content
