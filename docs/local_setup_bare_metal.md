## Synopsis

Sometimes it is needed to be able to run Insights Results Aggregator, DB
Writer, PostgreSQL database, and Kafka instance on bare metal. Just on bare
metal it would be possible to run benchmarks or performance tests and get
reliable results. This document contains description how to setup all such
tools and services on brand new Fedora 35 Server system.



## Basic setup

Some preparation steps to make the system usable and prepared to perform
following steps.



### System info

All steps described in this document have been performed on brand new Fedora 35
Server installation:

```
$ cat /etc/fedora-release 

Fedora release 35 (Thirty Five)
```

Kernel version:

```
$ uname -a

Linux hpe-dl380pgen8-02-vm-15.hpe2.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com 5.16.15-201.fc35.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Mar 17 05:45:13 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```



### Common packages to be used

First we need to install several packages that are not included in default
Fedora Server system:

```
# dnf install git
# dnf install wget
# dnf install tar
```


## PostgreSQL installation and setup

Install local PostgreSQL in case you need to run benchmarks and performance
tests against local DB running on bare metal.



### Package installation

Install:

```
# dnf install postgresql-server
```

Check installation:

```
$ psql --version

psql (PostgreSQL) 13.4
```



### Database setup

Initialize database:

```
# /usr/bin/postgresql-setup --initdb

 * Initializing database in '/var/lib/pgsql/data'
 * Initialized, logs are in /var/lib/pgsql/initdb_postgresql.log
```

Setup how users and services will be logged into DB:

```
# vim /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
```

Change to:

```
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
# local   all             all                                     peer
local   all             all                                     password
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            password
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 password
```



### Start DB service

Start the service:

```
# systemctl start postgresql

# systemctl status postgresql

● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL database server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Tue 2022-03-22 05:51:59 EDT; 2s ago

             ├─31516 /usr/bin/postmaster -D /var/lib/pgsql/data
             ├─31517 "postgres: logger " "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""

             └─31524 "postgres: logical replication launcher " "" "" ""
```

Check if the service has been really started and look for any error message or warning:

```

```


### Create PostgreSQL account

Change password for user `postgres`

```
# passwd postgres
Changing password for user postgres.
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
```

Change password in DB

```
psql -u postgres
postgres=# ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';
ALTER ROLE
```

## Kafka installation and setup

Install local Kafka in case you need to run benchmarks and performance
tests against local message broker.



### Package installation

Install Java package:

```
# dnf install java
```

Check installation:

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.14.1" 2022-02-08
OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.14.1+1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.14.1+1, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Get Kafka package:

```
$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/3.1.0/kafka_2.12-3.1.0.tgz

--2022-03-22 10:13:01--  https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/3.1.0/kafka_2.12-3.1.0.tgz

```

Decompress tarball:

```
tar xvfz kafka_2.12-3.1.0.tgz
```

### Start Zookeeper and Kafka

Start the Zookeeper first:

```
$ cd kafka_2.12-3.1.0

$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

[2022-03-22 10:34:33,179] INFO Reading configuration from: config/zookeeper.properties (org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerConfig)
[2022-03-22 10:34:33,179] INFO Reading configuration from: config/zookeeper.properties (org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerConfig)
[2022-03-22 10:34:33,190] INFO clientPortAddress is 0.0.0.0:2181 (org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerConfig)
```

Then start Kafka broker itself:

```
$ cd kafka_2.12-3.1.0

$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

[2022-03-22 10:36:47,534] INFO Registered kafka:type=kafka.Log4jController MBean (kafka.utils.Log4jControllerRegistration$)

```



## Kafkacat installation and setup

Install Kafkacat (now named Kcat) in order to be able to publish messages during benchmarking and testing.



### Installation

Install all required packages first:

```
# dnf install gcc-g++ cmake
# dnf install cyrus-sasl-devel zlib-devel libcurl-devel krb5-devel
```

Retrieve Kafkacat/Kcat sources:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat.git
$ cd kafkacat
```



### Build

Try to build Kafkacat/Kcat:

```
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```

Please note that sometimes it is needed to fix some "side" errors like
rebuilding `libyajl` by hands (it is located in `tmp-bootstrap/libyajl`
subdirectory).

Finally, check if binary has been produced:

```
$ ./kcat -V

kcat - Apache Kafka producer and consumer tool
https://github.com/edenhill/kcat
Copyright (c) 2014-2021, Magnus Edenhill
Version 1.7.1-2-g338ae3 (JSON, Avro, Transactions, IncrementalAssign, JSONVerbatim, librdkafka 1.8.2 builtin.features=gzip,snappy,ssl,sasl,regex,lz4,sasl_gssapi,sasl_plain,sasl_scram,plugins,zstd,sasl_oauthbearer)
```



### Check connection to Kafka

Now check if Kafkacat/kcat works as expected. We can use local broker that's been started already:

```
$ ./kcat -L -b localhost:9092

Metadata for all topics (from broker -1: localhost:9092/bootstrap):
 1 brokers:
  broker 0 at hpe-dl380pgen8-02-vm-15.hpe2.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com:9092 (controller)
 0 topics:
```


## Insights Results Aggregator installation and setup

Now Insights Results Aggregator can be installed and setup.



### Dependend packages installation

Install Go:

```
# dnf install go
```

Check if Go was installed correctly:

```
$ go version

go version go1.16.15 linux/amd64
```



### Insights Results Aggregator setup

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-results-aggregator.git

Cloning into 'insights-results-aggregator'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (7198/7198), done.
```

Build the service:

```
$ cd insights-results-aggregator
$ make
```

Check if the service has been built correctly:

```
$ ./insights-results-aggregator --help

Clowder is not enabled, skipping init...
Clowder is disabled

Command '--help' not found

Aggregator service for insights results

Usage:

    ./insights-results-aggregator [command]

The commands are:

    <EMPTY>             starts aggregator
    start-service       starts aggregator
    help                prints help
    print-help          prints help
    print-config        prints current configuration set by files & env variables
    print-env           prints env variables
    print-version-info  prints version info
    migration           prints information about migrations (current, latest)
    migration <version> migrates database to the specified version
```



### Aggregator database setup

First, empty database needs to be prepared in PostgreSQL:

```
# psql -U postgres

Password for user postgres:
psql (13.4)
Type "help" for help.



postgres=# create database aggregator;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# \q
```

Check if migration have not happened (yet):

```
$ ./insights-results-aggregator migration

```
$ psql -U postgres -h localhost

Password for user postgres:
psql (13.4)
Type "help" for help.
