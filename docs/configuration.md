# Configuration
{: .no_toc }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

Configuration is done by toml config, default one is `config.toml` in working directory,
but it can be overwritten by `INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR_CONFIG_FILE` env var.

Also each key in config can be overwritten by corresponding env var. For example if you have config

```toml
[storage]
db_driver = "sqlite3"
sqlite_datasource = "./aggregator.db"
pg_username = "user"
pg_password = "password"
pg_host = "localhost"
pg_port = 5432
pg_db_name = "aggregator"
pg_params = ""
```

and environment variables

```shell
INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__STORAGE__DB_DRIVER="postgres"
INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__STORAGE__PG_PASSWORD="your secret password"
```

the actual driver will be postgres with password "your secret password"

It's very useful for deploying docker containers and keeping some of your configuration
outside of main config file(like passwords).

## Broker configuration

Broker configuration is in section `[broker]` in config file

```toml
[broker]
address = "localhost:9092"
topic = "topic"
payload_tracker_topic = "payload-tracker-topic"
service_name = "insights-results-aggregator"
group = "aggregator"
enabled = true
save_offset = true
```

* `address` is an address of kafka broker (DEFAULT: "")
* `topic` is a topic to consume messages from (DEFAULT: "")
* `payload_tracker_topic` is a topic to which messages for the Payload Tracker are published (see `producer` package) (DEFAULT: "")
* `service_name` is the name of this service as reported to the Payload Tracker (DEFAULT: "")
* `group` is a kafka group (DEFAULT: "")
* `enabled` is an option to turn broker on (DEFAULT: false)
* `save_offset` is an option to turn on saving offset of successfully consumed messages.
The offset is stored in the same kafka broker. If it turned off,
consuming will be started from the most recent message (DEFAULT: false)

Option names in env configuration:

* `address` - INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__BROKER__ADDRESS
* `topic` - INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__BROKER__TOPIC
* `payload_tracker_topic` - INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__BROKER__PAYLOAD_TRACKER_TOPIC
* `service_name` - INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__BROKER__SERVICE_NAME
* `group` - INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__BROKER__GROUP
* `enabled` - INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__BROKER__ENABLED
* `save_offset` - INSIGHTS_RESULTS_AGGREGATOR__BROKER__SAVE_OFFSET

## Server configuration

Server configuration is in section `[server]` in config file.

```toml
[server]
address = ":8080"
api_prefix = "/api/v1/"
api_spec_file = "openapi.json"
debug = true
auth = true
auth_type = "xrh"
maximum_feedback_message_length = 255
```

* `address` is host and port which server should listen to
* `api_prefix` is prefix for RestAPI path
* `api_spec_file` is the location of a required OpenAPI specifications file
* `debug` is developer mode that enables some special API endpoints not used on production. In
production, `false` is used every time.
* `auth` turns on or turns authentication. Please note that this option can be set to `false` only
in devel environment. In production, `true` is used every time.
* `auth_type` set type of auth, it means which header to use for auth `x-rh-identity` or
`Authorization`. Can be used only with `auth = true`. Possible options: `jwt`, `xrh`
* `maximum_feedback_message_length` is a maximum possible length of a string for user's feedback

Please note that if `auth` configuration option is turned off, not all REST API endpoints will be
usable. Whole REST API schema is satisfied only for `auth = true`.

## CloudWatch configuration

CloudWatch configuration is in section `[cloudwatch]` in config file

```toml
[cloudwatch]
aws_access_id = "a key id"
aws_secret_key = "tshhhh it is a secret"
aws_session_token = ""
aws_region = "us-east-1"
log_group = "platform-dev"
stream_name = "insights-results-aggregator"
debug = false
```

* `aws_access_id` is an aws access id
* `aws_secret_key` is an aws secret key
* `aws_session_token` is an aws session token
* `aws_region` is an aws region
* `log_group` is a log group for aws logging
* `stream_name` is a stream name for aws logging. If you're deploying multiple pods,
you can add `$HOSTNAME` to the stream name so that they aren't writing to the same stream at once
* `debug` is an option to enable debug output of cloudwatch logging

## Metrics configuration

Metrics configuration is in section `[metrics]` in config file

```toml
[metrics]
namespace = "mynamespace"
```

* `namespace` if defined, it is used as `Namespace` argument when creating all
  the Prometheus metrics exposed by this service.
